# Soroban Smart Notes 📝

A decentralized, on-chain note-taking application built on the **Stellar Testnet** using the **Soroban Smart Contract** framework. [cite_start]This project demonstrates a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) cycle for managing persistent data on the blockchain. [cite: 66, 67]

## 📖 Description
[cite_start]**Soroban Smart Notes** is a smart contract designed to allow users to store personal notes securely on the Stellar network. [cite: 68] [cite_start]Each note is stored with a unique ID, a title, and content. [cite: 69] [cite_start]The contract handles state storage efficiently using Soroban's `instance` storage, ensuring that your data remains accessible and tamper-proof. [cite: 70]

## ✨ Key Features
* [cite_start]**Create Note:** Add new entries with a title and description. [cite: 71]
* [cite_start]**Get All Notes:** Retrieve the full list of stored notes in a structured format. [cite: 72]
* [cite_start]**Update & Delete:** Modify existing notes or remove them from the ledger using their unique IDs. [cite: 113]
* [cite_start]**Unique Identification:** Each note is automatically assigned a unique `u64` ID. [cite: 73]
* [cite_start]**Testnet Verified:** Fully deployed and tested using Stellar Laboratory and Soroban CLI. [cite: 74]

## 🔗 Deployment Details
* [cite_start]**Network:** Stellar Testnet [cite: 75]
* [cite_start]**Contract ID:** `CC2MXFL6AV4JN2M6KCKIAFBXGRE3TZ7AVPSKCG2JJMKQB3XLVKO5FIYP` [cite: 29, 75]
* [cite_start]**Wasm Hash:** `301d93b1a87e5ae4a104ee4b8e69731e7741a994fd5e660b48b6fc6953192a73` [cite: 75]

### Additional Guide:
1.  [cite_start]**Image Folder:** Create a folder named `screenshots` in your GitHub repository. [cite: 80]
2.  [cite_start]**Upload Screenshot:** Put the image file you have (for example `Screenshot 2026-04-16 130535.png`) into the folder and make sure the name matches the one written in the `README.md` file above. [cite: 80]
3.  [cite_start]**Account Identity:** Don't forget to replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME` with your local identity name (such as `release` or `indramahesa`) when running terminal commands. [cite: 81]
